# Garwick's Algorithm and a Modified Garwick's

This is my code for Garwick's Algorithm and an improvement called modified Garwick's

# Description of Problem

Computers have not always had large amounts of memory to store information. When memory was in low supply, storing multiple data structures with empty space could lead to large amounts of waste.

Garwick's proposed solution is to allocate all of the stacks to the same table space and manage the tops and bottoms of the stacks dynamically until the whole space is full. In Garwick's algorithm, the stacks "face" left to right/low to high. In modified Garwick's the stacks are paired off and face each other, one left to right/low to high and the stack facing it right to left/high to low. Below are two examples showing small configurations of both versions.

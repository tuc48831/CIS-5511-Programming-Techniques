# Topological Sort

This is my code for a topological sort created in java. It uses a node and linked list to keep track of information about the problem and it prints up to the first 10 topological orderings it can find, and then it yields the total number of permutations as a check to prove the programs correctness for problems too large to check manually.

# Description of Problem

## Explanation/Example from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/topological-sorting/

Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

For example, a topological sorting of the following graph is “5 4 2 3 1 0”. There can be more than one topological sorting for a graph. For example, another topological sorting of the following graph is “4 5 2 3 1 0”. The first vertex in topological sorting is always a vertex with in-degree as 0 (a vertex with no in-coming edges).
